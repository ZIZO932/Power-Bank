# DIY 120W Power Bank

Disclaimer: This project is still in progress, and there may be slight imperfections in the models or component fit.

I set out to build a high-power, compact 120-watt power bank. My goals were: high output power and a custom-designed circuit. The case has cutouts for ports (USB-A, USB-C, DC input). The outer shell is engraved with my logo and name to give it a personal touch.

## How to Build

- **Print the case**: The enclosure was designed in SolidWorks and is best printed in PETG for its thermal resistance and strength. A 3 mm wall thickness work well.
  
- **Prepare the electronics**:
  - Solder battery connectors to the 3S BMS board. Ensure polarity is correct.
  - Splice a USB-C cable and connect it to the BMS or buck-boost converter input for charging.
  - Connect the boost converter output to both the USB-A and USB-C output ports.
  - Attach the DC barrel jack to the BMS and buck module input if you plan to support DC charging.
  - Dont forget to add the voltmeter and battery lcds.

- **Install components**:
  - Begin by placing the battery cells securely in the case and soldering them to the BMS.
  - Mount the BMS, buck/boost converter, and output modules using screws or adhesive pads.
  - Fit the USB-A, USB-C, and DC jack into their respective cutouts.
  - Tidy up wiring with shrink tubing or small cable ties to prevent short circuits.

- **Power it up**:
  - Double-check all connections, especially battery polarity and grounding.
  - Insert a multimeter to test voltage on the output before plugging in any devices.
  - Once verified, you can use the power bank to charge phones, laptops, or any compatible USB devices up to 120 watts.
